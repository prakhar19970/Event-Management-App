# Event/ Task Management React App

This an app made with Vite + React + TS

It is an SPA where 

1. You can add events, or tasks tiles with some message and Date.
2. Your tasks are grouped by year 
3. You can Drag and Drop tiles --> within the Year group or in other Year Group.
4. Sort your tiles based on the date

For Input Components --> Input and Date picker --> shadCn is used.
For other Css changes --> Tailwind CSS is used.

I have used GlassMorphism for styling UI in app.
